Built binary classification models using Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (K=3)
on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset (UCI ML Repo, ID:17) to predict malignant vs. benign tumors.

Preprocessed data with label encoding and feature scaling.
Split dataset into 70/30 train-test sets.
Achieved >95% accuracy; evaluated with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Demonstrated effectiveness of tree-based and distance-based classifiers for medical diagnosis.
Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
